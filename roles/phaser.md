# Phaser

## Team: Impostor
The Phaser has the ability to mark a person. After some time, the Phaser can phase through reality, teleporting to the marked person and killing it.

## Notes:
- If someone is standing next to the target, the Phase button is grayed out.
- Phaser and Camouflager exclude each others.
